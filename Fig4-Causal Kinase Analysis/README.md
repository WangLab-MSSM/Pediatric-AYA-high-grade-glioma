### Table summarizing the codes available in this repository for the respective analysis/figures/tables

| Analysis/Figures/Tables | Section in the manuscript | Simplified Legend |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Fig 4A | Validating a Prognostic Score Based on Wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 Proteins | Survival plots comparing OS of male, H3 wild type patients with high or low IDH1/2 scores in the cDiscovery cohort based on either the TMT or the SRM protein data.  |
| Fig 4B | Glycosylation associated with the overall survival outcomes | Heatmap illustrating glycopeptides associated with OS from OS-associated pathways.  |
| Fig 4C | Age related neurodevelopment and tumor progression via CPSA | A heatmap illustrating the overlap between genes showing significant associations with OS across different sex and age groups from CPSA based on global protein or RNA data. |
| Fig 4D | OS associated pathways in different sex-age strata | Heatmaps illustrating the concordant OS association results from CPSA based on global protein data. The left heatmap represents pathway enrichment results, while the right heatmap illustrates selected protein associations.  |
| Fig 4E | Construction and validation of protein based OS risk scores | Coefficients with 90% confidence intervals for selected protein markers from penalized multivariate Cox regression (Ridge) in male patients. |
| Fig 4EF | Construction and validation of protein based OS risk scores | Coefficients with 90% confidence intervals for selected protein markers from penalized multivariate Cox regression (Ridge) in female patients. |
| Fig 4G | Construction and validation of protein based OS risk scores | Hazard ratios and their 90% CIs from Cox regression model  based on data from the cDiscovery cohort.  |
| Fig 4H | Construction and validation of protein based OS risk scores | Hazard ratios and their 90% CIs from Cox regression model  based on data from the Validation (H) cohort.  |
| Fig 4I | Construction and validation of protein based OS risk scores | Model adjusted survival plots comparing OS of tumors with high vs. low PHKG2 protein marker levels in the cDiscovery cohort. |
| Fig 4J | Construction and validation of protein based OS risk scores | Model adjusted survival plots comparing OS of tumors with high vs. low PHKG2 protein marker levels in the Validation cohort. |
