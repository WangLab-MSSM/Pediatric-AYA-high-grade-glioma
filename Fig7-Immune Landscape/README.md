### Table summarizing the codes available in this repository for the respective analysis/figures/tables

| Analysis/Figures/Tables | Section in the manuscript | Simplified Legend |
| :---: | :---: | ----- |
| Fig 7A | Immune signaling in PED/AYA HGG tumors | Heatmap showing estimated cell type fractions (z \- scored) by BayesDebulk for the cDiscovery tumors. |
| Fig 7B | Overall survival outcome differences across Protein Subtypes | Boxplots showing estimated fractions of T cells and SEPP1 Mo TAM stratified by age classes. |
| Fig 7C | Immune signaling in PED/AYA HGG tumors | Boxplots showing estimated fractions of T cells and SEPP1 Mo TAM stratified by protein clusters. |
| Fig 7D | Immune signaling in PED/AYA HGG tumors | Survival curves from the Cox regression model comparing female patients (ages 0â€“40) with low SEPP1 Mo TAM and high T cell infiltrations to those with high SEPP1 MoTAM and low T cell infiltrations in the cDiscovery cohort (Methods). Low/high infiltrations were derived using the median cell percentage as thresholds. ANOVA p- value testing the effect of SEPP1 Mo TAM and T cells from the COX model is reported. |
| Fig 7E | Immune signaling in PED/AYA HGG tumors | Survival curves from the sex-adjusted Cox regression model comparing patients with low SEPP1 Mo TAM and high T cell infiltrations to those with high SEPP1 Mo TAM and low T cell infiltrations in the Validation cohort. |
| Fig 7F | Immune signaling in PED/AYA HGG tumors | Boxplots showing estimated fractions of T cells and SEPP1 Mo TAM stratified by NF1 mutation status within the cDiscovery cohort.  |
| Fig 7G | Immune signaling in PED/AYA HGG tumors | Boxplots showing estimated fractions of T cells and SEPP1 Mo TAM stratified by H3-3A mutation status within the cDiscovery cohort. |
| Fig 7H | Immune signaling in PED/AYA HGG tumors | Heatmap showing associations between estimated T-cell and SEPP1 Mo TAM fractions and the gene/protein abundances of immune checkpoint genes across patient groups stratified by sex and age.	  |
