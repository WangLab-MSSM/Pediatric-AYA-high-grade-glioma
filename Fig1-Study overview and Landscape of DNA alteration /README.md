| Fig 1B | Methylation and Genomically informed Cancer Subtype Groups | Distribution of cancer groups stratified by PED and AYA  |
| Fig 1C | Age dependent Mutational and CNV Landscape of HGG | Oncoprint plot for the frequent (\>5%) mutations detected in the Discovery Cohort (N=89) |
| Fig 1D | Age dependent Mutational and CNV Landscape of HGG | Mutation frequency profiles along age for two groups of genes with distinct mutation patterns based on the Reference cohort data |
| Fig 1E | Age dependent Mutational and CNV Landscape of HGG | Association of overall survival with somatic mutation events across age groups in the Reference cohort, evaluated using multivariate Cox regression models. |
| Fig 1F | Transcriptomic and Proteomic Profiles Defining Adolescent versus Young Adult Age Groups | Multi-omic consensus clustering of temporal tumor molecular profiles (ages 0-80) from RNA, protein, and phospho-protein data.
